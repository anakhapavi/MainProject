# SMART BABY CRADLE USING IOT

Cradle is a device that is used to put babies to sleep. Cradle has a 
side- to-side rocking motion that eases the baby and put it to sleep. It takes lot
of efforts from parent to physically rock the cradle to generate swinging motion.
When baby is kept inside the cradle need to be constant monitoring parent to
keep to track of baby’s activity. An Arduino micro-controller will be used to
assemble all the sensors and hardware component required. Constant monitoring
of the baby inside the cradle will be done. If any activity such as urination or
baby crying, it occurs a notification through an SMS will be sent to the parent’s
device. The Smart cradle will also have additional features such as rocking the
baby automatically via geared motor mechanism.  Use of various sensors such as
sound sensor to detect baby sound, a moisture sensor for sensing wet conditions
and DHT11 sensor for measuring humidity and temperature. It is a complete parent-child supporting system.
